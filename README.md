## To Do
 - [ ] Serial Communication for controller.ino
 - [ ] Create rccar.ino for control of the car via onboard teensy
 - [ ] Serial communication for visionservo.py (receiving commands from controller)
 - [ ] Incorporate manual mode into visionservo.py

 ## Other Files
- servorccar.ino: Shows how you can hard code a brushless motor RC car to move using an Arduino Uno
- servotestrccar.ino: Shows how you can control a brushless motor RC car to move using an Arduino Uno and two potentiometers
- xbeeblinktest.ino: Testing if teensy can receive serial commmands through an xbee
- xbeeblinktestsend.ino: Testing if teensy can send serial commmands through an xbee
